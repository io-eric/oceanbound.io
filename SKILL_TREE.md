# ⚓ Skill Tree System ⚓

---

**Overview**

The skill tree is structured across three distinct paths: 💥 Cannoneer (Offensive), 🛡️ Seawarden (Defensive), and ⛵ Navigator (Movement). Each path is segmented into four tiers, representing progressive enhancements. Upon leveling up, players are presented with three skill options, one from each path, corresponding to their current tier in those paths.

Skill rarity, denoted as Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Epic, directly correlates with skill potency. Players manage a finite pool of skill points, demanding strategic allocation to specialize or diversify their playstyle.

**Rarity Distribution**

Skill selection is governed by the following rarity distribution:

| Rarity     | Probability |
|------------|-------------|
| ⚪ Common     | 40%         |
| 🟢 Uncommon   | 30%         |
| 🔵 Rare       | 20%         |
| 🟣 Epic       | 10%         |
