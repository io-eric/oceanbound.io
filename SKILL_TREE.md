# 🌊 SKILL TREE 🌊

---

## **How It Works**
The skill tree is divided into three paths: **Offensive (Cannoneer)**, **Defensive (Seawarden)**, and **Movement (Navigator)**. Each path has four tiers, and each tier offers two options. You can invest skill points in any direction, but **per tier, you can only choose one of the two options**. Once you’ve chosen an option in a tier, you can progress to the next tier in that category.

You’ll have a **limited number of total skill points** based on your level, so you’ll need to decide whether to specialize in one path or generalize across multiple paths. This system allows for a wide variety of playstyles and strategies, encouraging you to experiment and find what works best for your ship.
