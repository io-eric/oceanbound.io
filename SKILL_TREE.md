# ⚓ Skill Tree System ⚓
*Work in Progress 
---

**Overview**

Level up your ship and select upgrades from three distinct paths: 💥 **Cannoneer** (Offensive), 🛡️ **Seawarden** (Defensive), and ⛵ **Navigator** (Movement). Each path has four tiers of increasing power.

When you level up, you'll be presented with three skill options: one from your current tier in each path. Choose wisely, as you have limited skill points! Specialize in one path or create a balanced build. Skills have rarities (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic) which indicate their general impact.

* 🟢 = Common
* 🔵 = Uncommon
* 🟣 = Rare
* 🧿 = Epic

*(Active abilities may require a dedicated keybind, e.g., Right-Click)*
